## Hi there 👋 I'm Haohui, a master student 👨‍🎓 in MSc Computer Science at VU & UvA. 
Right now I am researching on Multi-agent System supervised by Eric Pauwels inCentrum Wiskunde & Informatica [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl/). My research interest covers deep reinforcement learning 🤖, multi-agent system 🤼, RL for mechanism or algorithm design 👨‍🔧, and algorithmic game theory 🎲.

### Find me all around the web:
