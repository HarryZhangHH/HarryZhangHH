## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Haohui, a master student in MSc Computer Science at VU & UvA. Right now I am researching on Multi-agent System supervised by Eric Pauwels inCentrum Wiskunde & Informatica [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl/). My research interest covers deep reinforcement learning , multi-agent system, RL for mechanism or algorithm design, and algorithmic game theory.
